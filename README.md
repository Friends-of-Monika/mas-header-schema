# MAS Header Schema

This project is aimed to provide precise JSON schema files for static analysis and validation of Monika After Story
submod header JSON file without a need to test it by launching the mod.


## Coverage

Currently, no schema files were tested against real world header JSON files. However, schema file works fine
with the example shown on [Monika After Story wiki page](https://github.com/Monika-After-Story/MonikaModDev/wiki/Interfacing-with-the-Submod-Framework#header-file).

## Usage

Pick the schema file ([here](header.schema.json)), and feed its content to any JSON schema validator along with your submod JSON header file.
